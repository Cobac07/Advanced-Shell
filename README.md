# Advanced-Shell
This is a website for a college project. We had to make a fictional company, and to make it look more professional I made a simple website. This is only visual, using just HTML/CSS(with bootstrap) and Javascript(with a litte bit of Jquery). The main version is in Spanish but there's a button to chage to the english version
The address and social networks are fake, all information given is fictional and nothing to be taken seious. I'm not a 'hacker' or a web security professional
